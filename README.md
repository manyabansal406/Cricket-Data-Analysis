##Data Collection:
Gathering comprehensive datasets including player performance metrics and match conditions.

##Data Preparation: 
Cleaning and preprocessing the data using Python.

##Analysis and Visualization:
Performing initial analysis with Python and creating interactive dashboards in Power BI.

##Reporting:
Creating interactive reports in Power BI to provide insights and support data-driven decision-making.

This approach combines the strengths of Power BI and Python for a comprehensive, data-driven team selection process..
